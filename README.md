# Satisfiability in python
This project is  some solution for solving satisfiability problem in python.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
satisfiability_bruteforce.py -> this is brute force solution.

satisfiability_recursive.py -> this is recursive solution.

satisfiability_hillclimbing.py -> this is hill climbing solution.

input.txt -> insert input boolean formula in this file.

#### input boolean formula must be in CNF form and every variable must start with % (%x , %y , %z , ...).
