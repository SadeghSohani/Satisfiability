# Satisfiability
This project is  some solution for solving satisfiability problem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
satisfiability.py -> this is brute force solution.
satisfiability_recursive.py -> this is recursive solution.
hillclimbing_satisfi.py -> this is hill climbing solution.
input.txt -> input boolean formula in this file.
input boolean formula must be in CNF form and every variable must start with % (%x , %y , %z , ...).
